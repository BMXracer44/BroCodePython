#For loops are important if you want to repeat a certain section of code
#Since I have already worked with for loops in other coding languages, I am only going to 
#gloss over this part of the video so I can become familiar with the language

import time
#for i in range(10):
#    print(i + 1)
#Counts from 1-10    

#for i in range(50, 100+1, 2):
#    print(i)
#Counts by 2 from 50-100

#for i in "Alex Ferguson":
#    print(i)      
#Prints out one letter of my string, each in a new line 

for seconds in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(seconds)
    time.sleep(1)
print("Happy new year!")         
#10 second timer 
#This is my first time using time in a program
