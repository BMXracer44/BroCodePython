#This is the code I wrote when learning user input form BroCode on YouTube
#User input is necessary for most programs and can be healful for real world
#Applications

#Inputing a string
name = input("What is your name?: ")

print("Hello " + name)

#Inputting a number
age = int(input("How old are you?: "))

print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

#Inputting a float
height = float(input("How tall are you in inches?: "))

print("You are " + str(height) + " inches tall.")

#I learned how to accept user input in Python which is necessary for most programs
