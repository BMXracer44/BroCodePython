#While loops are important for high level programs
#Since I have already learned about while loops in Java and another class, I will only gloss over this one

#while 1 == 1:
#    print("I am stuck in a loop!")

name = ""

#Can also do while not name:
while(len(name)) == 0:
    name = input("Enter your name: ")

print("Hello " + name)      
#Forces you to enter an input
